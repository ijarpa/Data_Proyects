## 🧪 Dataset Generation (Python)

The dataset was created using Python with the help of the `Faker`, `NumPy`, and `Pandas` libraries. It includes:

- 10,000 generated transactions
- 500 unique users

- 4 payment methods: Credit Card, Debit, Bank Transfer, Cryptocurrency
- Realistic timestamps, locations, and fraud behaviors

Fraudulent transactions have:
- Higher average amounts
